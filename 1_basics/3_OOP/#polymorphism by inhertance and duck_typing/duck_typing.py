#Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#Poly = Many
#Morphe = Form

#TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
#1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods

#"Duck typing" = Another way to achieve polymorphism besides Inheritance
#Object must have the minimum necessary attributes/methods
#"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."

"""
âœ… Difference in Simple Terms
Inheritance Polymorphism:
Classes are forced to follow a shared structure (interface/abstract base class).
Safer: you're guaranteed all subclasses have the same method.
More strict and organized.
Duuk Typing Polymorphism:
No need for a common parent class.
More flexible but less safe: if an object doesn't have the expected method, it crashes.
Used often in Python because Python values flexibility."""
