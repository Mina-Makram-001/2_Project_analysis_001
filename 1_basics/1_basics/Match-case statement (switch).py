#match / case 
#Works like a switch statement in other languages.
#Compares a value against specific patterns or cases.
#Cleaner when youâ€™re checking one variable against many possible values.

#but

#if / elif / else
#Used for conditional logic.
#Checks whether a condition is True or False.
#Can test any kind of condition (comparisons, ranges, logic, etc.)

#and

#Key differences:
#Use if when:
#You need to check ranges (x > 5), multiple conditions (x > 5 and y < 10), or logic.
#The conditions are not just about "equal to something".
#Use match when:
#You are checking one variable against a list of possible fixed values.
#It makes the code shorter and easier to read
